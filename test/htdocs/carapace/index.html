                <p>
                    This site uses crustls to embed rustls into mod_tls to
                    enable secury and memory safe access to apache. What a
                    jumble of words!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a technology that makes crashes much more rare and
                    exploitations of weaknesses much harder. This is called `Rust`
                    and it is a programming language that enforces more discipline
                    and rewards efforts with less likely screw-ups by the
                    programmer.

                    Since web servers on the internet are exposed to the Bad Guys,
                    making your web server more secure seems a good idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site runs a new apache module named `mod_tls`, which
                    does basically what the well known `mod_ssl` does: securing
                    your server with `https`. Only instead of the `OpenSSL` library
                    it uses `rustls` which provides the encryption of your site
                    using Rust, memory-safe technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Added protection for your apache web server.
